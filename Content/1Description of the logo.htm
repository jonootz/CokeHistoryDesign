        <p>There are various versions that are currently being used, however the main components of the official logo are made of three elements.</p>
        <p>The absolute main component of the logo is the lettering. It uses a script type font. The script type is "Spencerian" which was a popular style in the late 1900's. This was the original logo.</p>
        <p>The colors are red and white. Red is used for the background and white is used for the lettering although there are times when the colors are inverted depending on where and how it is used.</p>
        <p>The "dynamic ribbon" is another element that usually is placed below the lettering. The color of the wave matches the color of the lettering.</p>
        <p>In addition to the main logo, Coca-Cola uses a few more designs to represent them and they are very important to their corporate identity. The contour bottle and the "Dynamic Ribbon" and both are used on various things without the Coca-Cola lettering such as soft drink cups, </p>
