        <p>There are various versions that are currently being used, so the main components of the official logo are made of three elements: The lettering, the colors, and the "dynamic wave".</p>
        <h2>Lettering</h2>
        <p>The base logo uses a script type font called "<MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />" which was a popular style in the late 1900's. This was the original logo except it is more refined now whereas originally it was handwritten. The script spells out the words "Coca" and "Cola" with a hyphen in the middle. The first "C" has a tail on the bottom that underlines the "oca". The second "C"&#160;has a tail on top that swoops over the top of "ola" and it threads through the "l". Currently this can be use with and without the "dynamic wave".</p>
        <h2>The Dynamic Wave</h2>
        <p>The "dynamic ribbon" is another element that usually is placed below the lettering. It is called many things such as the swirl, the spiral, the wave, and the ribbon. The color of the wave matches the color of the lettering. It basically starts to the left of the lettering and curves downward below the "Cola" part where it becomes much thinner, then it curves upward and thickens as it goes to the right of the lettering.</p>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>The colors are red and white. The basic logo is the red lettering with a transparent background. But it is more commonly used inverted with the red for the background and white is used for the lettering depending on where and how it is used.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In addition to the main logo, Coca-Cola uses a few more designs to represent the brand and they are very important to their corporate identity </p>
        <h2>The Bottle</h2>
        <p>The bottle design is an alternative logo that is widely used. The bottle it self was originally designed with the soda's two main ingredients in mind, the coca leaf and the kola nut. The coca leaf is narrow at the stem and widens in the middle and curves to a point. The kola bean typically has ridged shell which causes lines that go from end to end. The "contour" bottle, as it is commonly known as, reflects the combination of both. The base is wide, then it curves in then out as you reach the middle part. The middle is wide for approximately a third of the bottles height so that it can be held easily then it curves inward towards the bottle opening where it is capped. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> logo label or embossed  logo goes in the middle area. The shape of the bottle represents the coca leaf. There are raised vertical ridges that appear around the bottle that represent the kola bean. The label with the logo goes across the middles section which is flat and free of the ridges. The logo can be a label, or white lettering, or embossed lettering, and all three versions use the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />. Starting back in 2009, the bottle shape has been used frequently as a graphic with the silhouette of the bottle design being colored in a flat red and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> stretched across the middle.</p>
        <h2>The Disc</h2>
        <p>The disc is also an alternative logo. </p>
