        <p>There are various versions that are currently being used, however the main components of the official logo are made of three elements.</p>
        <h2>Lettering</h2>
        <p>The absolute main component of the logo is the lettering. The base logo uses a script type font called "<MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />" which was a popular style in the late 1900's. This was the original logo except it is more refined now whereas originally it was handwritten.</p>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>The colors are red and white. Red is used for the background and white is used for the lettering although there are times when the colors are inverted depending on where and how it is used.</p>
        <h2>Wave</h2>
        <p>The "dynamic ribbon" is another element that usually is placed below the lettering. The color of the wave matches the color of the lettering.</p>
        <p>In addition to the main logo, Coca-Cola uses a few more designs to represent them and they are very important to their corporate identity. </p>
        <h2>The Bottle</h2>
        <p>the soda's two ingredients, the coca leaf and the kola nut</p>
        <p>The contour bottle and the "Dynamic Ribbon" and both are used on various things without the Coca-Cola lettering such as soft drink cups, </p>
