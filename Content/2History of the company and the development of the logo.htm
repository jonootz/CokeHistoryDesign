        <h1>History of the company and the development of the logo</h1>
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>The first servings of Coca&#8209;Cola were sold for 5 cents per glass. During the first year, sales averaged a modest nine servings per day in Atlanta. Today, daily servings of Coca&#8209;Cola beverages are estimated at 1.9 billion globally. (https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/)</p>
        <p><cite>The purpose of Coca-Cola invented was actually served as ‘patent medicine’ for five cent a glass and it went for sales for the first time at Jacob’s Pharmacy in Atlanta, Georgia, US. It went so popular that people believe this carbonated water was good for health. (http://www.sureewoong.com/uncategorized/coca-cola-logo/)</cite>
        </p>
        <p><cite>Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink.[1] It is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta, Georgia, and is often referred to simply as Coke (a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States since March 27, 1944) (wiki)</cite>
        </p>
        <p>In 1886 the drink was founded by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jp" /> who was a pharmacist who was trying to create an elixir for medicinal purposes. The syrup was to be mixed with seltzer water from soda fountains, which were very popular back in the late 1900's. </p>
        <p>Robinson, who served as bookkeeper and partner to Pemberton, gave the syrup formula the name Coca-Cola, where Coca came from the coca leaves used and Cola for the kola nuts (<a href="Citations.htm#Boney">Boney</a>, 1987).</p>
        <p>Robinson suggested that Coca-Cola was appropriate because the two "C"s would stand out</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />started marketing the drink using a serif font. The next year <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />turned again to Robinson to help with a more professional, catchy logo. So Robinson penned the script himself using Specierian Style script which was popular at the time. The script was used at the time in schools when teaching children how to write.</p>
        <h2>Acquisition from Pemberton</h2>
        <p>A business man named <MadCap:variable name="Variables.asa" />bought <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" /></p>
        <p><cite>Coca-Cola was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century (from Wiki)</cite>
        </p>
        <p>In 1892, Coca-Cola formula and brand were bought by Asa Candler that led Coca-Cola dominate the world of soft drinks market throughout 20th century. <cite>(http://www.sureewoong.com/uncategorized/coca-cola-logo/)</cite></p>
        <p>Under Mr. Candler’s leadership, distribution of Coca&#8209;Cola expanded to soda fountains beyond Atlanta((https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/)</p>
        <h2>Bottling pre 1915</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-13T21:27:41.0957331-08:00" MadCap:creator="Harkins" MadCap:initials="HA" MadCap:comment="cited-done" MadCap:editor="Harkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-13T21:27:46.3724235-08:00">In 1894 Mississippi shop owner Joseph A. Biedenharn was impressed by Coca&#8209;Cola that he bottled it in what was a common glass bottle at the time called a Hutchinson and sent a case to Asa Griggs Candler. Candler was polite and thanked him, but never accepted Biedenham's offer to bottle the drink because he thought bottling would not take off (<a href="Citations.htm#Journey">Journey Staff, "Contour Bottle History"</a>)</MadCap:annotation>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bottling was a challange because of the success of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> there were now imitators to bank off of the success. To protect them seleves "lack of packaging consistency among the 1,000 bottling plants at the time. The bottlers agreed that a distinctive beverage needed a standard and distinctive bottle" (https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/)</p>
