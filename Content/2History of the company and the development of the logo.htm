        <h1>History of the company and the development of the logo</h1>
        <p>1886 Founded by Pemberton who was a pharmacist. He invented the formula originally as a medicine to be mixed with selzter water as selzter water was very popular back in the late 1900's.</p>
        <p>Robinson, who served as bookkeeper and partner to Pemberton, gave the syrup formula the name Coca-Cola, where Coca came from the coca leaves used and Cola for the kola nuts (<a href="Citations.htm#Boney">Boney</a>, 1987).</p>
        <p>Robinson suggested that Coca-Cola was appropriate because the two "C"s would stand out</p>
        <p>Robinson penned the script himself using Specierian Style script which was popular at the time. The script was used at the time in schools when teaching children how to write.</p>
        <p>Pemberton</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century (from Wiki)</p>
