        <h1>Who was the designer(s)?</h1>
        <h2>The logo</h2>
        <p><cite>The Coca-Cola logo was created by John Pemberton's bookkeeper, Frank Mason Robinson, in 1885.(http://inventors.about.com/od/advertisingmedia/ss/Coca_Cola_Comp.htm#step2)</cite>
        </p>
        <p><cite>Robinson, who served as bookkeeper and partner to Pemberton, gave the syrup formula the name Coca-Cola, where Coca came from the coca leaves used and Cola for the kola nuts (</cite><cite href="Citations.htm#Boney">Boney</cite><cite>, 1987).</cite>
        </p>
        <p><cite>When launched, Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were cocaine and caffeine. The cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut, leading to the name Coca-Cola (the "K" in Kola was replaced with a "C" for marketing purposes)(http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/sports-nutrition-is-coca-cola-an-effective-sports-drink-713?#) or (http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/coca_cola.htm)</cite>
        </p>
        <p><cite>After 1904, instead of using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using "spent" leaves – the leftovers of the cocaine-extraction process with trace levels of cocaine.[66] Since then, Coca-Cola uses a cocaine-free coca leaf extract prepared at a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey.[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/business/how-coca-cola-obtains-its-coca.html]</cite>
        </p>
        <p><cite>The astute amongst you may notice the lack of a registration symbol on this logo. At this point in its lifespan, the brand had not yet been registered at the patent office. The trademark would not be officially granted for a few more years. Of course by this point, various iterations of the logo existed in their crude forms. Lacking the modern tooling we take for granted today, many different artists would ended up recreating the logo by hand, giving it a rough and generally inconsistent look.
