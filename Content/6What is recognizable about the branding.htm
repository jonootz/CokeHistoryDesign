        <h1>What is recognizable about the branding?</h1>
        <p>The branding has some constants that are so importantant to their identity that for approximately 125 years <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> is a brand that most anyone can recognize in any country of the world. The distinct lettering of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />which has been consistent over the lifetime of the product, the colors, red and white are so recognizable that there is no mistake what soft drink it is. One of the younger additions to the assets (50 years young) is the use of the "dynamic wave". The "contour" bottle alone without any label is recognizble by most everyone due to it's unique shape. Even thoughout the course of history, the contour bottle has been updated several times due to advancements made to the glass, or the plastic bottle taking it's classic form, to the newest modernized aluminin versions of them. The "hobbledress" bottle, as it was referred to a century ago has outlasted the test of time.</p>
