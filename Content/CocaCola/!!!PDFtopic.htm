        <p>Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink and is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta, Georgia. In 1886 the drink was founded by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jp"></MadCap:variable> who was a pharmacist who was trying to create an elixir for medicinal purposes. The syrup was to be mixed with seltzer water from soda fountains, which were very popular back in the late 1900's. "The first servings of Coca&#8209;Cola were sold for 5 cents per glass. During the first year, sales averaged a modest nine servings per day in Atlanta. Today, daily servings of Coca&#8209;Cola beverages are estimated at 1.9 billion globally" (Coca-Cola History).</p>
        <p>Robinson, who served as bookkeeper and partner to Pemberton, gave the syrup formula the name Coca-Cola, where Coca came from the coca leaves used and Cola for the kola nuts (<a href="../Citations.htm#Boney">Boney</a>, 1987).</p>
        <p>Robinson suggested that Coca-Cola was appropriate because the two "C"s would stand out</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.p"></MadCap:variable>started marketing the drink using a serif font. The next year <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p"></MadCap:variable>turned again to Robinson to help with a more professional, catchy logo. So Robinson penned the script himself using Specierian Style script which was popular at the time. The script was used at the time in schools when teaching children how to write.</p>
        <h2>Acquisition from Pemberton</h2>
        <p>In 1892, Coca-Cola formula and brand were bought by a business man named <MadCap:variable name="Variables.asa"></MadCap:variable>acuired <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p"></MadCap:variable>and his marketing tactics led Coke's distribution of Coca&#8209;Cola expanded to soda fountains beyond Atlanta, then to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century (sureewoong).</p>

Biedenharn was impressed by Coca&#8209;Cola that he bottled it in what was a common glass bottle at the time called a Hutchinson and sent a case to Asa Griggs Candler. Candler was polite and thanked him, but never accepted Biedenham's offer to bottle the drink because he thought bottling would not take off (<a href="../Citations.htm#Journey">Journey Staff, "Contour Bottle History"</a>)</MadCap:annotation>

        <p>Bottling was a challange because of the success of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> there were now imitators and lack of packaging consistency among the 1,000 bottling plants at the time, the bottlers agreed that a distinctive beverage needed a standard and distinctive bottle (Coca-Cola History)</p>

Even though the Company itself has it's own logo I want to focus on it's flagship product <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>. The company logo "The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> Company" is a great example of how recogniable and unique the branding of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>is - they simply insert the words "The" before the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>logo and "Company" after it in the same <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc"></MadCap:variable>. There are various versions that are currently being used that make up <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>'s corporate identity system. The main logo is "Coca-Cola" writing in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc"></MadCap:variable> which is a moderized version of the original script logo is main main piece. Over the course of it's history it has evolved, and currently they use five of elements that were introduce over time in different ways" interchangably and separately. The main components of the official logo are made of five elements: The lettering, the colors, the "dynamic wave", the bottle shape, and of course the "Coke" nickname.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h2>Lettering</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T11:44:44.2863582-08:00" MadCap:creator="jharkins" MadCap:initials="JH" MadCap:comment="done" MadCap:editor="jharkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T11:44:45.8307658-08:00">The base logo uses a script type font called "<MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc"></MadCap:variable>" which was a popular style in the late 1900's. This was the original logo except it is more refined now whereas originally it was handwritten. The script spells out the words "Coca" and "Cola" with a hyphen in the middle. The first "C" has a tail on the bottom that underlines the "oca". The second "C"&#160;has a tail on top that swoops over the top of "ola" and it threads through the "l". Currently this can be use with and with and without the "dynamic wave".</MadCap:annotation>
        </p>
        <h2>The Dynamic Wave</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T11:44:51.2220758-08:00" MadCap:creator="jharkins" MadCap:initials="JH" MadCap:comment="done" MadCap:editor="jharkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T11:44:54.3478254-08:00">The "dynamic ribbon" is another element that usually is placed below the lettering. It is called many things such as the swirl, the spiral, the wave, and the ribbon. The color of the wave matches the color of the lettering. It basically starts to the left of the lettering and curves downward below the "Cola" part where it becomes much thinner, then it curves upward and thickens as it goes to the right of the lettering. This element is so recogniable that with the "Share a Coke" campaign, the wave can be used with ideas and names in place of the "Coca-Cola" script.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>

The basic logo is the red lettering with a transparent or white background. But it is more commonly used on packaging and advertising inverted, with the red for the background and white is used for the lettering depending on where and how it is used.</MadCap:annotation>

The bottle itself was originally designed with the soda's two main ingredients in mind, the coca leaf and the kola nut. The coca leaf is narrow at the stem and widens in the middle and curves to a point. The kola bean typically has ridged shell which causes lines that go from end to end. The "contour" bottle, as it is commonly known, reflects the combination of both. The shape of the bottle represents the coca leaf. The base is wide, then it curves in then out as you reach the middle part. The middle is wide for approximately a third of the bottles height so that it can be held easily then it curves inward towards the bottle opening where it is capped. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> logo label or embossed  logo goes in the middle area.  The texture of the bottle represents the kola bean. There are raised vertical ridges that appear around the bottle that represent the kola bean. The label with the logo goes across the middles section which is flat and free of the ridges. The logo can be a label, or white lettering, or embossed lettering, and all three versions use the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc"></MadCap:variable>. The bottle has been used on the first can to help people recognize that Coke was now in a can. The in the 1990's it was agin used on cans with the "Always" campaign. Starting back in 2009, the bottle shape has been used frequently as a graphic with the silhouette of the bottle design being colored in a flat red or white and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc"></MadCap:variable> stretched across the middle.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h1>Who was the designer(s)?</h1>
        <h2>The logo</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>logo was designed and penned by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p"></MadCap:variable>'s bookkeeper Frank Mason Robinson in 1885. Robinson suggested the name "Coca-Cola" after the two main ingredients. Cocaine which was taken from the coca leaves and caffeine taken from kola nuts. He suggested to Pemberton that instead of a "K" that they use a "C" because the two "C"s would appear more catchy in advertising (Boney, 1987). <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T16:35:50.3580678-08:00" MadCap:creator="Harkins" MadCap:initials="HA" MadCap:comment="done cited\r\n" MadCap:editor="Harkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T16:35:55.9718679-08:00">In</MadCap:annotation> regards to the cocaine, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>started using spent leaves insteas of fresh ones after 1904 because the only had trace levels of cocaine left in them yet still provided the necassary taste. Since then <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> uses cocaine free coca leaf extract prepared at a Stephan Company in Maywood New Jersey. After 1904, instead of using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using "spent" leaves – the leftovers of the cocaine-extraction process with trace levels of cocaine. Since then, Coca-Cola uses a cocaine-free coca leaf extract prepared at a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey (May, 1988.</p>

It is said that he stated, “We need a bottle which a person can recognize as a Coca-Cola bottle when he feels it in the dark.” The Coca-Cola Company decided to launch a competition among bottle suppliers. The objective was to come up with a distinctive design (1915 Coca-Cola Prototype Bottle and Concept Sketch). Earl R. Dean who worked for the Root Glass Bottling company came up with the design basing it on the same two ingredients that inspired Robinson for the name. But Dean was inspired by the shapes of the kola nut and the coca leaf.</MadCap:annotation>

"In 1948, the discs began to be hung inside a place of business as advertising and decoration". The Red Disc appeared in print advertising up through the 1960’s when the Arciform or “fish tail” signs began to be used. (Fletcher, 2014). There have been many variations of it such as just the white <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> logo, then they added the contour bottle illutration behind it, then in the 1990's they re-used it with the slogan "Always" above it in a green (sometimes blue) banner that followed the curve of the circle on top. In the 2000's it was made flat with no metallic shine and displayed the main logo with the wave in it. Most recently they dropped the wave and brought back a subtle shine.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h1>What is unique about the logo / identity?</h1>
        <h2>The script</h2>
        <p>The script plays a big part, it is classy and nostalgic, recognized by the whole world even is it is not translated.</p>
        <h2>The Bottle</h2>
        <p>The bottle is unique in it's original design that even though it has evolved it is still recognizable. </p>
        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <p>The script is very versatile and can be used with various elements and never be overshadowed.  When the colors are inverted they are actually even more powerful and striking as the red really stands out. The script and wave can be updated (like in the 1990's to 2000's) to show more flare and yet can easily be reverted back to it's simplest form and look even more modern than ever.</p>
        <p>Marketing is always trying to reach out to the world and show that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> cares about the world.</p>
        <h2>Other brands</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> Company has a huge portfolio including various flavors and variations of the flagship drink that have come and gone and still have many still in production such as Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Zero, and Coca-Cola Vanilla. In either case these variations always follow closely to the identity branding based on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>'s current look. </p>
        <p>Other non related Coke products that the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> Company owns also share the corporate identity is many ways such as similar messaging, bottling, and branding. Their identity is universal in a way that individual components of the logo can be used separately. Through the years of it's existence, "happiness" is a constant message.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>6</p>
        <h1>What is recognizable about the branding?</h1>
        <p>The branding has some constants that are so important to their identity that for approximately 125 years <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> is a brand that most anyone can recognize in any country of the world. The distinct lettering of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc"></MadCap:variable>which has been consistent over the lifetime of the product, the colors, red and white are so recognizable that there is no mistake what soft drink it is. One of the younger additions to the assets (50 years young) is the use of the "dynamic wave". The "contour" bottle alone without any label is recognizable by most everyone due to it's unique shape. Even throughout the course of history, the contour bottle has been updated several times due to advancements made to the glass, or the plastic bottle taking it's classic form, to the newest modernized aluminin versions of them. The "hobbledress" bottle, as it was referred to a century ago has outlasted the test of time. </p>
        <p>Advertising is also reconcilable with sophisticated looking women from the early 20th century going back to Hilda Clark, a famous singer and actress from the late Nineteenth Century. From 1899-1903 her image was used on a wide variety of advertising materials such as serving and change trays, signage, trading cards, and clocks, among other things (Nestor, 2014). </p>
        <p>Santa Claus has been an annual holiday tradition for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />. Beginning in the 1930s "the Coca-Cola company was looking for ways to increase sales of their product during winter" to increase sales since the end of the year was a slow period of business "and they turned to a talented commercial illustrator named Haddon Sundblom, who created a series of memorable drawings" which were inspired by Clement Clark Moore's 1822 poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas" (The Claus That Refreshes). Common myth is that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> is credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as an old man in a red-and-white suit, but earlier illustrations from the early Twentieth century prove that they are not the creators. They only helped shape Santa for the modern audience. Polar Bears are part of the holidayseason as well. They were used from time to time going back to 1922 in &#160;French print ad, however in 1993 <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> started usig them consistantly when the "Always Coca-Cola" campaign campaign began. The campaign began with the Creative Artists Agency (and later Edge Creative) with an initial run of 27 commercials designed to appeal to specific audiences. It was a world-wide campaign using computer animation. Typically in the commercials, the polar bears would watch the Northern Lights as if it was a movie and they drank from bottles of Coca-Cola.</p>

        <h1>How has technology influenced the evolution of your company and the development of their corporate identity - logo?</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Through the years as technology influence the evolution of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> and their logo as well as their corporate identity. </p>
        <p>Printed materials were the first form of advertising until radio commercials and then television commercials. Most recently with the new age of the world wide web, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> has taken presence there too. Their websites are full of everything from their corporate information, their stance on real world issues, history of their company and it has been a great medium for advertising in many ways including with social media and apps on smartphones. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>has reached in every direction to take advantage of technology to reach out to the public in order to establish their presence and show that they are modern, hip, that they produce refreshing drinks, and are all about caring.</p>
        <p>In terms of physical property and how manufacturing technology has affected them, since the glass bottles were used and although they remain as part of the product line advancement in technology to incorporate aluminum cans in the 1960's and plastic bottles in the 1990's and the most recently aluminum bottles in the 2000's. These advancements in the way allowed  packaging their drink with more real estate for advertising. Some of the choices such as cans are much more affordable, other like glass bottles are nostalgic, while their plastic bottles have a big presence in conveince, and the aluminum bottles are the new and hip.</p>
        <p>As the graphic design industry advanced, the script became more well rounded, perfected, and modernized. Products like the cans have evolved to included more graphics really acting like <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>'s perfect billboard.</p>
        <p>As society is more self ware of how bad sugar is, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>has pushed to make lower calorie drinks such as Diet Coke which is very successful, but the taste was always different, so advancement in science has allowed <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>to release coca zero. This all allowed them to offer more to different needs and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> has always stayed true to the design of coke for all of these variations.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's "Coca&#8209;Cola introduced the world to the two litre PET plastic bottle. It became popular for a lot of reasons: it doesn’t break; it’s re-sealable, lightweight and recyclable".(100 years of the Coca-Cola Bottle). Most recently the company has started to promote the PlantBottle which is made of packaging that uses a process to turn sugarcane in a key component of the bottle. It is said that "The material looks and functions just like traditional PET plastic, but has a lighter footprint on the planet and its scarce resources" (PlantBottle).</p>
