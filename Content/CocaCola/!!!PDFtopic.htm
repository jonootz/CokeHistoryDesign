        <p>Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink that is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta, Georgia. In 1886 the drink was founded by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jp" /> who was a pharmacist trying to create an elixir for medicinal purposes. The syrup was to be mixed with seltzer water from soda fountains, which were very popular back in the late 1900's. "The first servings of Coca&#8209;Cola were sold for 5 cents per glass. During the first year, sales averaged a modest nine servings per day in Atlanta. Today, daily servings of Coca&#8209;Cola beverages are estimated at 1.9 billion globally" (Coca-Cola History).</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />logo was designed and penned by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />'s bookkeeper Frank Mason Robinson in 1885. Robinson suggested the name "Coca-Cola" after the two main ingredients. Cocaine which was taken from the coca leaves and caffeine taken from kola nuts. He suggested to Pemberton that instead of a "K" that they use a "C" because the two "C"s would appear more catchy in advertising (Boney, 1987). </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />started marketing the drink using a serif font. The next year <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />turned again to Robinson to help with a more professional, catchy logo. So Robinson penned the script himself using Spencerian Style script which was very popular at the time, the script was even used in schools when teaching children how to write.</p>
        <p>In 1892, the Coca-Cola formula and brand were acquired by a business man named <MadCap:variable name="Variables.asa" />. His marketing tactics led the distribution of Coca&#8209;Cola to expand to soda fountains beyond Atlanta, then to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century (sureewoong).</p>

Biedenharn was impressed by Coca&#8209;Cola that he bottled it in what was a common glass bottle at the time called a "Hutchinson" and sent a case to Asa Griggs Candler. At first Candler was polite and thanked him, but never accepted Biedenham's initial offer to bottle the drink because he thought bottling would not take off (<a href="../Citations.htm#Journey">Journey Staff, "Contour Bottle History"</a>)</MadCap:annotation>

        <p>Bottling was a challenge because of the success of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />, there were now imitators and lack of packaging consistency among the 1,000 bottling plants at the time, the bottlers agreed that a distinctive beverage needed a standard and distinctive bottle (Coca-Cola History)</p>

Even though the Company itself has it's own logo I want to focus on it's flagship product <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />. The company logo "The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> Company" is a great example of how recognizable and unique the branding of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />is - they simply insert the words "The" before the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />logo and "Company" after it in the same <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />. There are various versions that are currently being used that make up <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />'s corporate identity system. The main logo is "Coca-Cola" written in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> which is now a modernized version of the original script logo scripted by Robinson. Over the course of it's history it has evolved, and currently they use four elements (in addition to color) that were introduced over time in different ways, both interchangeably and separately. The main components of the official logo are made of five elements: The lettering, the colors, the "dynamic wave", the bottle shape, and of course the "Coke" nickname.</MadCap:annotation>

This was the original logo except it is more refined now whereas originally it was handwritten. The script spells out the words "Coca" and "Cola" with a hyphen in the middle. The first "C" has a tail on the bottom that underlines the "oca". The second "C"&#160;has a tail on top that swoops over the top of "ola" and it threads through the "l". Currently this can be use with and with any of the other elements and is at the forefront of their corporate website. </MadCap:annotation>

It is called many things such as the swirl, the spiral, the wave, and the ribbon. The color of the wave matches the color of the lettering. It basically starts to the left of the lettering and curves downward below the word "Cola"  where it becomes much thinner, then it curves upward and thickens as it goes to the right of the lettering. This element is so recognizable that with the recent "Share a Coke" campaign, the wave can be used with ideas or names in place of the "Coca-Cola" script.

The bottle itself was originally designed with the soda's two main ingredients in mind, the coca leaf and the kola nut. The coca leaf is narrow at the stem and widens in the middle and curves to a point. The kola bean typically has ridged shell which causes lines that go from end to end. The "contour" bottle, as it is commonly known, reflects the combination of both. The shape of the bottle represents the coca leaf. The base is wide, then it curves in, then widens as you reach the middle part. The middle is wide for approximately a third of the bottles height so that it can be held easily, then it curves inward towards the bottle opening where it is capped. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> logo label or embossed  logo goes in the middle area.  The texture of the bottle represents the kola bean. There are raised vertical ridges that appear around the bottle that represent the kola bean. The label goes across the middles section which is flat and free of the ridges. The logo can be a label, or white lettering, or embossed lettering, and all three versions use the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> with and without the wave. The bottle has been used on the first can to help people recognize that Coke was now in a can. The in the 1990's it was used again on cans with the "Always" campaign. Starting back in 2009, the bottle shape has been used frequently used as a graphic with the silhouette of the bottle design colored red or white and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> stretched across the middle.</MadCap:annotation>

It is just a circle with a flat red color and the white <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> inside of it. The latest version does have a slight shine on the left edge and a slight shadow on the right edge. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T17:36:46.9896792-08:00" MadCap:creator="Harkins" MadCap:initials="HA" MadCap:comment="done\r\n" MadCap:editor="Harkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T17:36:50.1448835-08:00">Back in 1947 <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> designed a Red Disc, also known as the “button” sign and has been used from time to time since 1947 which may have been inspired by the circular <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> signs from the 1930's. "In 1948, the discs began to be hung inside a place of business as advertising and decoration". The Red Disc appeared in print advertising up through the 1960’s when the Arciform or “fish tail” signs began to be used. (Fletcher, 2014). There have been many variations of it such as just the white <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> logo, then they added the contour bottle illutration behind it, then in the 1990's they re-used it with the slogan "Always" above it in a green (sometimes blue) banner that followed the curve of the circle on top. In the 2000's it was made flat with no metallic shine and displayed the main logo with the wave in it. Most recently they dropped the wave and brought back a subtle shine.</MadCap:annotation></MadCap:annotation>

It is said that he stated, “We need a bottle which a person can recognize as a Coca-Cola bottle when he feels it in the dark.” The Coca-Cola Company decided to launch a competition among bottle suppliers. The objective was to come up with a distinctive design (1915 Coca-Cola Prototype Bottle and Concept Sketch). Earl R. Dean who worked for the Root Glass Bottling company came up with the design basing it on the same two ingredients that inspired Robinson for the name. But Dean was inspired by the shapes of the kola nut and the coca leaf.</MadCap:annotation>

Some of the notable that really stand the test of time are ones like 1963's slogan "Things go better with Coke.", 1970's "It's the real thing.", 1982's "Coke is it!", 1985's "America's real choice.", 1986's "Red, white &amp; you." (for Coca-Cola Classic), 1986's "Catch the wave." (for New Coke), 1987's "You can't beat the feeling!.", 1990's "Can't Beat The Real Thing.", 1993's "Always Coca-Cola.", 2000's "Enjoy", 2009's "Open Happiness", and 2014's "Share A Coke". A few notable ones that actual were included in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> logo were "Drink", "Enjoy", and "Always". The overall theme here is obvious that Coke is all about happiness, good times and sharing. These are wonderful messages and really affect people from all around the world.</MadCap:annotation></p>
        <p>Regarding the history and developement, the first version of the Coca-Cola logo was in capital serif letters in the first newspaper advertisement for the drink which appeared in the Atlanta Journal on May 29th, 1886 (Martin). The original version of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> was reportedly first used in June 16, 1887 but it took over 5 years to register it in 1892 then the trademark registration was granted on January 31, 1893. Until this point the logo was always hand written so it was not always consistent in design in regards to the flow and thickness of the letters, the slant may have been a little off, the tail to the left of the first "o" was not always drawn in, which was dropped anyway in the more modern versions (Martin). The logo used red right from the start. in it advertising.</p>
        <p>However just before the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> version was granted its first trademark from the patent office, in 1890-1891 a fancy serif font version was also used sometimes. The "C"s both had tails on the bottom and the tops of them swirled into itself like a spiral. Below the lowest part of the spiral on the inside there were two swirls that dangled from it (The Logo Story). There was another variation with diamonds floating inside the "C"s instead of the dangling swirls in 1892.</p>

The colors red and white were prominent in the adverts while green was an accent color used quite frequently. The ads consisted of both graphic design that focused on just typography and others where the center piece was either the contour bottle (after that came around), or graphics of soda fountains, as well as sophisticated looking women holding the glasses or bottles of Coke.</p>

Many 'copycat' bottlers were trying to take advantage of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />name by naming their drinks in a similar way and using the same straight edge bottles <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> was known for. So <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />approached many glass manufacturers to come up with a unique bottle design for them. The Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, was the winner of the contest as Earl R.Dean (who worked for Root Glass) designed the famous contour shaped bottle. Coca&#8209;Cola approved it in 1915 and it was introduced to the consumer in 1916 (Hobbs).</MadCap:annotation>
        </p>
        <p>By the 1920's, the lettering and symmetry was closer to what the modern version looks like except for the required TRADE&#160;MARK REGISTERED lettering in the tail. In the mid 1920s the word "DRINK" would also appear above the logo in much of their signage and advertising, along with the infamous "5 cents per glass" pricing (The History of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />).</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-13T23:11:55.2841051-08:00" MadCap:creator="Harkins" MadCap:initials="HA" MadCap:comment="done cited" MadCap:editor="Harkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-13T23:11:58.1802274-08:00">By the 1940s, the word Trademark was removed from the tail and placed underneath the logo and the script had evolved to its most familiar design in which the script was slightly altered to be even and more circular, meaning that each letter had the perfect slant and the form of each letter is more rounded. This is the form that we still see today. Also in 1941 the public saw the first use of the nickname "Coke" as an official trademark (Logopedia). </MadCap:annotation>From this point on, this will be the base logo and in years to come, elements will be added to and there are times when this logo, just the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> will be used alone. Up until 1957 the words <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> were blown into the glass, but in 1957 it was printed with white label on glass and trademarked (100 years of the Coca-Cola Bottle). The fishtail design was introduce d in 1958 and lasted until 1969. The script was placed in a red Arciform shape and on each end there where triangular cutouts which made it look like fish tails.</p>
        <p>The "famous" diamond can was the first introduced in 1960. The body was red with a white diamond as the center piece outlined in silver. The Script logo was inside of the diamond and behind that was a line drawing of the contour bottle so that people would recognize that it was <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />in a can (http://www.coca-colacompany.com/timeline-the-evolution-of-the-coca-cola-bottle/#1960).

        <p>The logo for "Coke" started appearing in on the aluminum cans too, and one of the first slogans to be used with the new graphic was the "Things Go Better With Coke" campaign in 1965.</p>
        <p>In 1969 <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />introduced the "Arden Square" as their brand new logo. It featured the classic <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> in white with the famous 'Dynamic Ribbon, or 'White Swirl' for the first time. Above the script in sans-serif was the word "Enjoy". They were laid over a red square. This logo lasted for almost 20 years until Coke was re-branded in 1987 (The History of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />)</p>
        <p>In 1971 a song from a Coca-Cola commercial called "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing", produced by Billy Davis, became a hit single and was featured in the famous commercial dubbed I would like to buy the world a coke. In 1977 the bottle itself was granted registration as a trademark. A earlier study showed that only less than 1% of Americans could not identify the bottle by shape alone (http://www.coca-colacompany.com/timeline-the-evolution-of-the-coca-cola-bottle/#1977).</p>
        <p>The cola wars occured in the 1980's, and "<cite>For the first time in its history, Coca Cola was no longer the most popular soft drink. By this point Pepsi's popularity and sales had surpassed their own and the company was in full damage control mode. In response the company changed its formula and launched a bold new brand, snubbing its script logo in favor of a thick slab serif font to accompany their rebrand as Coke</cite>(http://fineprintnyc.com/blog/the-history-of-the-coca-cola-logo). Enter "New Coke" which was <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />'s solution to beat out Pepsi. The company changed the serif version of "Coke" instead of the traditional <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> logo. They also added silver to outline the word "Coke" and added another layer to the wave which was silver. In addition to that they slapped a silver label on the top of the can with the word "New" in it. Despite all their efforts and regardless if the drink tasted good, many long time Coke drinkers and fans created such a backlash that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />was forced to bring back the original formula. Enter "Coca-Cola Classic". "Classic" was added to the name to differentiate the two sodas and New Coke was renamed to Coke II. But required redesigns. Coke II&#160;took on a slanted serif font and both it and the wave were accented with blue outlines. Then Coke Classic updated the traditional can look with the words going up sideways on the can, but instead of the wave, then used the word "Classic" along with a new icon indicating "Original Formula". By the 1990's the look was updated again whereas the ribbon graphic was integrated further into the script itself, intersecting with the "o" in Cola(http://fineprintnyc.com/blog/the-history-of-the-coca-cola-logo). By 1993, with the "Always" campaign, the wave is gone again and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> focused on bringing the traditional graphics such as the disc, the contour bottle and bottle caps onto the can.</p>
        <p>In 1993 a 20 oz PET&#160;bottle is created to help distinguish the plastic bottles from other soft drink bottles just like the glass version did so many years before by making a "Contour" version.(http://www.coca-colacompany.com/timeline-the-evolution-of-the-coca-cola-bottle/#1993)</p>
        <p>In the 2000's the Dynamic Ribbon, (the wave) comes back but with bubbles, and yellow outlines, and thicker with more lines in it. "Coca-Cola Classic" name was reverted back to "Coca-Cola" since there was no longer any "New Coke" production. The disc becomes simplified "minimal version of the classic red disc was reintroduced for corporate / retail purposes"(http://fineprintnyc.com/blog/the-history-of-the-coca-cola-logo). Then the wave becomes simpler like it was before New Coke era - The can retained the red coloring and the white lettering with a simplified swirl.</p>
        <p>Open happiness campaign is an homage to an earlier campaign “The Pause That Refreshes” from 1929 inviting people all around to world to relax with the refreshment of a coke (https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/)</p>
        <p>"One Brand" is a refresh for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>'s branding. They are combining all related "Coke" products under the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> umbrella as far as branding goes. For instance the original formula (the flagship product) is now displayed horizontally across the can like it has always has been on the bottles. The traditional logo script spans across the can once taking up the top half of the can and below it is the white dynamic wave. The other three main "Coke" related products: <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>Life, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> Zero, and Diet Coke follow the same design, all now just display <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>on the upper half of the can just like the flagship except Diet Coke which displays Diet Coke but now in the same <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc"></MadCap:variable> to match better. Each also have the wave placed the same way. This really ties the four products together. Each can does have a unique color and accent color that they retain from previous designs. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>Life's can is green and the accent color, that includes the wave color and font color are both white just like regular Coke's. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> Zero's can is black with accent color being red, and Diet Coke in which the can is silver and red as the accent color with the exception of "Diet" which has been black for many years now. Below the main logo and above the wave in much smaller font are descriptions that identify the differences of each product and also displayed is the unique names: Life, zero which appear as subtitles in a way which is a powerful way to signify that they are really part of the<MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> family.</p>

        <p>The branding has some constants that are so important to their identity being so recognizable, that for approximately 125 years <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> is a brand that most anyone can recognize in any country of the world. The distinct lettering of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc"></MadCap:variable>which has been consistent over the lifetime of the product, the colors, red and white are so recognizable that there is no mistake what soft drink it is. One of the younger additions to the assets (50 years young) is the use of the "dynamic wave". The "contour" bottle alone without any label is recognizable by most everyone due to it's unique shape. Even throughout the course of history, the contour bottle has been updated several times due to advancements made to the glass, or the plastic bottle taking it's classic form, to the newest modernized aluminin versions of them. The "hobbledress" bottle, as it was referred to a century ago has outlasted the test of time. </p>
        <p>Advertising is also reconcilable with sophisticated looking women from the early 20th century going back to Hilda Clark, a famous singer and actress from the late Nineteenth Century. From 1899-1903 her image was used on a wide variety of advertising materials such as serving and change trays, signage, trading cards, and clocks, among other things (Nestor, 2014). </p>
        <p>Santa Claus has been an annual holiday tradition for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />. Beginning in the 1930s "the Coca-Cola company was looking for ways to increase sales of their product during winter" to increase sales since the end of the year was a slow period of business "and they turned to a talented commercial illustrator named Haddon Sundblom, who created a series of memorable drawings" which were inspired by Clement Clark Moore's 1822 poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas" (The Claus That Refreshes). Common myth is that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> is credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as an old man in a red-and-white suit, but earlier illustrations from the early Twentieth century prove that they are not the creators. They only helped shape Santa for the modern audience. Polar Bears are part of the holidayseason as well. They were used from time to time going back to 1922 in &#160;French print ad, however in 1993 <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> started usig them consistantly when the "Always Coca-Cola" campaign campaign began. The campaign began with the Creative Artists Agency (and later Edge Creative) with an initial run of 27 commercials designed to appeal to specific audiences. It was a world-wide campaign using computer animation. Typically in the commercials, the polar bears would watch the Northern Lights as if it was a movie and they drank from bottles of Coca-Cola.</p>

        <p>Technology influenced the evolution of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> and the development of their corporate identity - logo in various ways. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T16:35:50.3580678-08:00" MadCap:creator="Harkins" MadCap:initials="HA" MadCap:comment="done cited\r\n" MadCap:editor="Harkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T16:35:55.9718679-08:00">In</MadCap:annotation> regards to the cocaine, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />started using spent leaves instead of fresh ones after 1904 because they only had trace levels of cocaine left in them yet still provided the necessary taste. Since then, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> uses cocaine free coca leaf extract prepared at a Stephan Company in Maywood New Jersey. After 1904, instead of using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using "spent" leaves – the leftovers of the cocaine-extraction process with trace levels of cocaine. Since then, Coca-Cola uses a cocaine-free coca leaf extract prepared at a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey (May, 1988.</p>
        <p>Through the years as technology influence the evolution of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> and their logo as well as their corporate identity. </p>
        <p>Printed materials were the first form of advertising until radio commercials and then television commercials. Most recently with the new age of the world wide web, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> has taken presence there too. Their websites are full of everything from their corporate information, their stance on real world issues, history of their company and it has been a great medium for advertising in many ways including with social media and apps on smartphones. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>has reached in every direction to take advantage of technology to reach out to the public in order to establish their presence and show that they are modern, hip, that they produce refreshing drinks, and are all about caring.</p>
        <p>In terms of physical property and how manufacturing technology has affected them, since the glass bottles were used and although they remain as part of the product line advancement in technology to incorporate aluminum cans in the 1960's and plastic bottles in the 1990's and the most recently aluminum bottles in the 2000's. These advancements in the way allowed  packaging their drink with more real estate for advertising. Some of the choices such as cans are much more affordable, other like glass bottles are nostalgic, while their plastic bottles have a big presence in conveince, and the aluminum bottles are the new and hip. As the graphic design industry advanced, the script became more well rounded, perfected, and modernized. Products like the cans have evolved to included more graphics really acting like <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>'s perfect billboard.</p>
        <p>As society is more self ware of how bad sugar is, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>has pushed to make lower calorie drinks such as Diet Coke which is very successful, but the taste was always different, so advancement in science has allowed <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>to release coca zero. This all allowed them to offer more to different needs and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> has always stayed true to the design of coke for all of these variations.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's "Coca&#8209;Cola introduced the world to the two litre PET plastic bottle. It became popular for a lot of reasons: it doesn’t break; it’s re-sealable, lightweight and recyclable".(100 years of the Coca-Cola Bottle). Most recently the company has started to promote the PlantBottle which is made of packaging that uses a process to turn sugarcane in a key component of the bottle. It is said that "The material looks and functions just like traditional PET plastic, but has a lighter footprint on the planet and its scarce resources" (PlantBottle).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>What makes the logo / identity unique is the script plays a big part, it is classy and nostalgic, recognized by the whole world even is it is not translated. The bottle is unique in it's original design that even though it has evolved it is still recognizable. The script is very versatile and can be used with various elements and never be overshadowed.  When the colors are inverted they are actually even more powerful and striking as the red really stands out. The script and wave can be updated (like in the 1990's to 2000's) to show more flare and yet can easily be reverted back to it's simplest form and look even more modern than ever.</p>
        <p>Marketing is always trying to reach out to the world and show that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> cares about the world. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable> Company has a huge portfolio including various flavors and variations of the flagship drink that have come and gone and still have many still in production such as Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Zero, and Coca-Cola Vanilla. In either case these variations always follow closely to the identity branding based on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc"></MadCap:variable>'s current look. </p>
        <p>Other non related Coke products that the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> Company owns also share the corporate identity is many ways such as similar messaging, bottling, and branding. Their identity is universal in a way that individual components of the logo can be used separately. Through the years of it's existence, "happiness" is a constant message.</p>
