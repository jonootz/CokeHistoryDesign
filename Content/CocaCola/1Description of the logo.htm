Even though the Company itself has it's own logo I want to focus on it's flagship product <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />. The company logo "The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> Company" is a great example of how recogniable and unique the branding of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />is - they simply insert the words "The" before the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />logo and "Company" after it in the same <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />. There are various versions that are currently being used that make up <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />'s corporate identity system. The main logo is "Coca-Cola" writing in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> which is a moderized version of the original script logo is main main piece. Over the course of it's history it has evolved, and currently they use five of elements that were introduce over time in different ways" interchangably and separately. The main components of the official logo are made of five elements: The lettering, the colors, the "dynamic wave", the bottle shape, and of course the "Coke" nickname.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h2>Lettering</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T11:44:44.2863582-08:00" MadCap:creator="jharkins" MadCap:initials="JH" MadCap:comment="done" MadCap:editor="jharkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T11:44:45.8307658-08:00">The base logo uses a script type font called "<MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />" which was a popular style in the late 1900's. This was the original logo except it is more refined now whereas originally it was handwritten. The script spells out the words "Coca" and "Cola" with a hyphen in the middle. The first "C" has a tail on the bottom that underlines the "oca". The second "C"&#160;has a tail on top that swoops over the top of "ola" and it threads through the "l". Currently this can be use with and with and without the "dynamic wave".</MadCap:annotation>
        </p>
        <h2>The Dynamic Wave</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T11:44:51.2220758-08:00" MadCap:creator="jharkins" MadCap:initials="JH" MadCap:comment="done" MadCap:editor="jharkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T11:44:54.3478254-08:00">The "dynamic ribbon" is another element that usually is placed below the lettering. It is called many things such as the swirl, the spiral, the wave, and the ribbon. The color of the wave matches the color of the lettering. It basically starts to the left of the lettering and curves downward below the "Cola" part where it becomes much thinner, then it curves upward and thickens as it goes to the right of the lettering. This element is so recogniable that with the "Share a Coke" campaign, the wave can be used with ideas and names in place of the "Coca-Cola" script.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T11:45:14.5515087-08:00" MadCap:creator="jharkins" MadCap:initials="JH" MadCap:comment="done" MadCap:editor="jharkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T11:45:16.0515129-08:00">The colors are red and white. The basic logo is the red lettering with a transparent or white background. But it is more commonly used on packaging and advertising inverted, with the red for the background and white is used for the lettering depending on where and how it is used.</MadCap:annotation>

        </p>
        <h2>The Bottle</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T11:58:00.2998261-08:00" MadCap:creator="jharkins" MadCap:initials="JH" MadCap:comment="donish" MadCap:editor="jharkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T11:58:02.8987802-08:00">The bottle design is an alternative logo that is widely used as a graphic because of how recognizable it is. The bottle itself was originally designed with the soda's two main ingredients in mind, the coca leaf and the kola nut. The coca leaf is narrow at the stem and widens in the middle and curves to a point. The kola bean typically has ridged shell which causes lines that go from end to end. The "contour" bottle, as it is commonly known, reflects the combination of both. The shape of the bottle represents the coca leaf. The base is wide, then it curves in then out as you reach the middle part. The middle is wide for approximately a third of the bottles height so that it can be held easily then it curves inward towards the bottle opening where it is capped. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> logo label or embossed  logo goes in the middle area.  The texture of the bottle represents the kola bean. There are raised vertical ridges that appear around the bottle that represent the kola bean. The label with the logo goes across the middles section which is flat and free of the ridges. The logo can be a label, or white lettering, or embossed lettering, and all three versions use the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />. The bottle has been used on the first can to help people recognize that Coke was now in a can. The in the 1990's it was agin used on cans with the "Always" campaign. Starting back in 2009, the bottle shape has been used frequently as a graphic with the silhouette of the bottle design being colored in a flat red or white and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> stretched across the middle.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h2>The Disc</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T11:58:09.1242360-08:00" MadCap:creator="jharkins" MadCap:initials="JH" MadCap:comment="done" MadCap:editor="jharkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T11:58:10.5549229-08:00">The disc is also an alternative logo. It is just a circle with a flat red color and the white <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" /> inside of it. The latest version does have a slight shine on the left edge and a slight shadow on the right edge.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h2>Coke</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T11:58:15.8766942-08:00" MadCap:creator="jharkins" MadCap:initials="JH" MadCap:comment="done" MadCap:editor="jharkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T11:58:17.6750609-08:00">In 1966 <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />started using another alternative logo, one to represent the nickname for the drink that is most commonly used, "Coke". This uses a serif font and spells "Coke".</MadCap:annotation>
