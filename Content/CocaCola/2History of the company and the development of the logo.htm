        <h1>History of the company and the development of the logo</h1>
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink and is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta, Georgia. In 1886 the drink was founded by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jp" /> who was a pharmacist who was trying to create an elixir for medicinal purposes. The syrup was to be mixed with seltzer water from soda fountains, which were very popular back in the late 1900's. "The first servings of Coca&#8209;Cola were sold for 5 cents per glass. During the first year, sales averaged a modest nine servings per day in Atlanta. Today, daily servings of Coca&#8209;Cola beverages are estimated at 1.9 billion globally" (Coca-Cola History).</p>
        <p>Robinson, who served as bookkeeper and partner to Pemberton, gave the syrup formula the name Coca-Cola, where Coca came from the coca leaves used and Cola for the kola nuts (<a href="../Citations.htm#Boney">Boney</a>, 1987).</p>
        <p>Robinson suggested that Coca-Cola was appropriate because the two "C"s would stand out</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />started marketing the drink using a serif font. The next year <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />turned again to Robinson to help with a more professional, catchy logo. So Robinson penned the script himself using Specierian Style script which was popular at the time. The script was used at the time in schools when teaching children how to write.</p>
        <h2>Acquisition from Pemberton</h2>
        <p>In 1892, Coca-Cola formula and brand were bought by a business man named <MadCap:variable name="Variables.asa" />acuired <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />and his marketing tactics led Coke's distribution of Coca&#8209;Cola expanded to soda fountains beyond Atlanta, then to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century (sureewoong).</p>
        <h2>Bottling pre 1915</h2>

Biedenharn was impressed by Coca&#8209;Cola that he bottled it in what was a common glass bottle at the time called a Hutchinson and sent a case to Asa Griggs Candler. Candler was polite and thanked him, but never accepted Biedenham's offer to bottle the drink because he thought bottling would not take off (<a href="../Citations.htm#Journey">Journey Staff, "Contour Bottle History"</a>)</MadCap:annotation>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bottling was a challange because of the success of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> there were now imitators and lack of packaging consistency among the 1,000 bottling plants at the time, the bottlers agreed that a distinctive beverage needed a standard and distinctive bottle (Coca-Cola History)</p>
