        <h1>Who was the designer(s)?</h1>
        <h2>The logo</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />logo was designed and penned by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.p" />'s bookkeeper Frank Mason Robinson in 1885. Robinson suggested the name "Coca-Cola" after the two main ingredients. Cocaine which was taken from the coca leaves and caffeine taken from kola nuts. He suggested to Pemberton that instead of a "K" that they use a "C" because the two "C"s would appear more catchy in advertising (Boney, 1987). <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T16:35:50.3580678-08:00" MadCap:creator="Harkins" MadCap:initials="HA" MadCap:comment="done cited\r\n" MadCap:editor="Harkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T16:35:55.9718679-08:00">In</MadCap:annotation> regards to the cocaine, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />started using spent leaves insteas of fresh ones after 1904 because the only had trace levels of cocaine left in them yet still provided the necassary taste. Since then <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> uses cocaine free coca leaf extract prepared at a Stephan Company in Maywood New Jersey. After 1904, instead of using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using "spent" leaves – the leftovers of the cocaine-extraction process with trace levels of cocaine. Since then, Coca-Cola uses a cocaine-free coca leaf extract prepared at a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey (May, 1988.</p>

It is said that he stated, “We need a bottle which a person can recognize as a Coca-Cola bottle when he feels it in the dark.” The Coca-Cola Company decided to launch a competition among bottle suppliers. The objective was to come up with a distinctive design (1915 Coca-Cola Prototype Bottle and Concept Sketch). Earl R. Dean who worked for the Root Glass Bottling company came up with the design basing it on the same two ingredients that inspired Robinson for the name. But Dean was inspired by the shapes of the kola nut and the coca leaf.</MadCap:annotation>

        <h2>The Wave</h2>

        <h2>The Disc</h2>

            <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2015-12-14T17:36:46.9896792-08:00" MadCap:creator="Harkins" MadCap:initials="HA" MadCap:comment="done\r\n" MadCap:editor="Harkins" MadCap:editDate="2015-12-14T17:36:50.1448835-08:00">Back in 1947 <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> designed a Red Disc, also known as the “button” sign and has been used from time to time since 1947 which may have been inspired by the circular <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> signs from the 1930's. "In 1948, the discs began to be hung inside a place of business as advertising and decoration". The Red Disc appeared in print advertising up through the 1960’s when the Arciform or “fish tail” signs began to be used. (Fletcher, 2014). There have been many variations of it such as just the white <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> logo, then they added the contour bottle illutration behind it, then in the 1990's they re-used it with the slogan "Always" above it in a green (sometimes blue) banner that followed the curve of the circle on top. In the 2000's it was made flat with no metallic shine and displayed the main logo with the wave in it. Most recently they dropped the wave and brought back a subtle shine.</MadCap:annotation>
