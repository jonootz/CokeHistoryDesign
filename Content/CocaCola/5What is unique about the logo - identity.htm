        <h1>What is unique about the logo / identity?</h1>
        <h2>The script</h2>
        <p>The script plays a big part, it is classy and nostalgic, recognized by the whole world even is it is not translated.</p>
        <h2>The Bottle</h2>
        <p>The bottle is unique in it's original design that even though it has evolved it is still recognizable. </p>
        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <p>The script is very versatile and can be used with various elements and never be overshadowed.  When the colors are inverted they are actually even more powerful and striking as the red really stands out. The script and wave can be updated (like in the 1990's to 2000's) to show more flare and yet can easily be reverted back to it's simplest form and look even more modern than ever.</p>
        <p>Marketing is always trying to reach out to the world and show that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> cares about the world.</p>
        <h2>Other brands</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> Company has a huge portfolio including various flavors and variations of the flagship drink that have come and gone and still have many still in production such as Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Zero, and Coca-Cola Vanilla. In either case these variations always follow closely to the identity branding based on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />'s current look. </p>
        <p>Other non related Coke products that the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> Company owns also share the corporate identity is many ways such as similar messaging, bottling, and branding. Their identity is universal in a way that individual components of the logo can be used separately. Through the years of it's existence, "happiness" is a constant message.</p>
