        <h1>What is recognizable about the branding?</h1>
        <p>The branding has some constants that are so important to their identity that for approximately 125 years <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> is a brand that most anyone can recognize in any country of the world. The distinct lettering of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.spenc" />which has been consistent over the lifetime of the product, the colors, red and white are so recognizable that there is no mistake what soft drink it is. One of the younger additions to the assets (50 years young) is the use of the "dynamic wave". The "contour" bottle alone without any label is recognizable by most everyone due to it's unique shape. Even throughout the course of history, the contour bottle has been updated several times due to advancements made to the glass, or the plastic bottle taking it's classic form, to the newest modernized aluminin versions of them. The "hobbledress" bottle, as it was referred to a century ago has outlasted the test of time. </p>
        <p>Advertising is also reconcilable with sophisticated looking women from the early 20th century going back to Hilda Clark, a famous singer and actress from the late Nineteenth Century. From 1899-1903 her image was used on a wide variety of advertising materials such as serving and change trays, signage, trading cards, and clocks, among other things (Nestor, 2014). </p>
        <p>Santa Claus has been an annual holiday tradition for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" />. Beginning in the 1930s "the Coca-Cola company was looking for ways to increase sales of their product during winter" to increase sales since the end of the year was a slow period of business "and they turned to a talented commercial illustrator named Haddon Sundblom, who created a series of memorable drawings" which were inspired by Clement Clark Moore's 1822 poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas" (The Claus That Refreshes). Common myth is that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> is credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as an old man in a red-and-white suit, but earlier illustrations from the early Twentieth century prove that they are not the creators. They only helped shape Santa for the modern audience. Polar Bears are part of the holidayseason as well. They were used from time to time going back to 1922 in &#160;French print ad, however in 1993 <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cc" /> started usig them consistantly when the "Always Coca-Cola" campaign campaign began. The campaign began with the Creative Artists Agency (and later Edge Creative) with an initial run of 27 commercials designed to appeal to specific audiences. It was a world-wide campaign using computer animation. Typically in the commercials, the polar bears would watch the Northern Lights as if it was a movie and they drank from bottles of Coca-Cola.</p>
